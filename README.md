# Terminologies of Indonesian Objects in the NMVW

## Premise

- in many cases, Dutch titles & names for objects are not translations of Indonesian titles & names
  --> often, the Dutch terms are applied in hindsight, merely describing the kind of object from a Dutch lense)

 - consequences of that are:
   - Indonesian objects are often not findable with the original Indonesian terminology
   - objects and their cultural values and functions are misrepresented (e.g. saying simply "pot" when the object in question has spiritual value)
   - connections between objects and concepts are missing in the collection 

 - Indonesian terminologies are (partly) present and linked to objects, meaning that they can be found
   --> however, the object titles and descriptions often don't reflect this, don't mention those same terms and therefore make it intransparent _why_ an object corresponds to a search

## First Steps

 - gather objects that are findable with _known_ Indonesian terminologies
 - identify objects that may correspond, e.g. via Dutch terminologies, places, etc
 - gather Dutch terms used on Indonesian objects (& investigate differences)
 - inventorise NMVW thesaurus (and of other institutions?)

### Immediate TODOs

 - find objects that have Indonesian translations (titles)
 - 
 - expand set of case studies


### To Move Further

 - write up report of issues:
   - enriched examples to set goal
   -  
 - think of strategies, using computational aid to use human knowledge effectively 

## Need

 - richer & more Indonesian terminologies
 - (at least) examples of objects that are titled, named & described with proper Indonesian terminology (and translated into Dutch?) 


## Case Studies



### sirih 

 - aka (/sireh), pinang (/penang)

 - sets used for consumption of Betel nuts (Areca nut)  

Object records

 - "Betelstel - papangadjaiyang": https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/592495  
   -> found with term "pinang"


### martavan

 - aka (/martaban), tempayan, coengtong (-> where?)
 - term related to 'Gulf of Martaban' (also in the NMVW thesaurus), both named after a port-city in Myanmar with the same name
 - earthenware vessels used
